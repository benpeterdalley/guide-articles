## Brute Force Algorithms

Brute force algorithms are ones where every solution is considered before the best solution found<sup>1</sup>.  

An example of its use in programming is in penetration testing, where a brute force algorithm can be used to crack pin numbers<sup>2</sup>.

A brute force algorithm relies on a computer's ability to perform a repetitive task. Because the potential complexity of the solution increases exponentially as new factors are introduced (in Big O notation - O(n!)), brute force algorithms are not efficient or suitable for sitations where there are a large number, or infinite number of possibilities as this would be out with the processing power of any computer<sup>3, 4, 5</sup>.
